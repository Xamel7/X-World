## Github

Github is a new way to for me to code and try new formats for my website.

## We learned about Headings from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level.

## Alternate Syntax
Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2.

## Emphasis
You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.

## Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

## Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

## Blockquotes 
To create a block, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

Paragraphs are created like this
Line breaks are done.
