# Wireframe

>Purpose: A wireframe is a basic, low-fidelity representation of a website or application interface, used to illustrate and test its layout, structure and content before moving on to design and development.

>Content: A wireframe should include all the key elements of the interface, such as the header, footer, navigation menu, main content area, and any additional sections. The focus should be on the placement and organization of elements, not the design details.

>Simplicity: Wireframes should be simple, without unnecessary details, graphics, or colors. The purpose is to quickly test and iterate ideas without getting bogged down in design.

>Interactivity: Interactive elements, such as buttons and links, can be represented by simple boxes or shapes. The focus should be on testing the basic functionality of the interface, rather than the specific details of the interactions.

>Usability: Wireframes can be used to test the usability of an interface and ensure that it is easy to use and navigate. They can also help identify potential problems before they become more complicated and costly to fix.

>Collaboration: Wireframes can be a valuable tool for collaboration between designers, developers, stakeholders, and end-users, as they allow everyone to contribute and give feedback on the interface.

>Iteration: Wireframes are not meant to be final products, but rather a starting point for iteration and improvement. They can and should be revised and refined as feedback is received and ideas are developed further.
