## What is css for?

>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information.

## CSS syntax

>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

>CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified.

## CSS specifications

>All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.

## External CSS

>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

>Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

## Internal CSS

>An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

>The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.

## Inline CSS

>An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

>To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
