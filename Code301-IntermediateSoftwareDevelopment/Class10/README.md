## In memory storage

# What is a ‘call’?
The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

# How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
You will notice that the arrangement of the functions as a stack begins with the firstFunction() (which is the last function that got into the stack, and is popped out to throw the error), followed by the secondFunction(), and then the thirdFunction() (which is the first function that gets pushed into the stack when the code is executed).

# What does LIFO mean?
At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

# Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

# What causes a Stack Overflow?
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

## JavaScript error messages

# What is a ‘reference error’?
When a variable or identifier is referenced but has not been declared or defined. It typically happens when a program tries to access a variable that is out of scope or does not exist within the current context.

# What is a ‘syntax error’?
When the code violates the grammar or syntax rules of the programming language. It means that the code is not written in a way that the compiler or interpreter can understand and execute it.

# What is a ‘range error’?
When a value is outside the allowable range of values for a particular operation or data type.

# What is a ‘type error’?
