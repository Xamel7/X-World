## Joe's notes for Class 102 Repo

## My introduction 
How's it going everybody?The name's Joel.I'm working towards becoming a software developer;so that I can start developing video games with one of my favorite companies.

## [Growth Mindset]
Nothing vertured is nothing gained.Challenges present new alleys to show what you're made of.Just because you stuggle doesn't mean give up;or you will always fail just short of your goals.Persistent is key;While patient is a virtue.You need both to succeed in anything you do.
