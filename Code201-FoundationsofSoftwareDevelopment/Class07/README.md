## Domain Modeling

#  Explain why we need domain modeling.

# A domain model that’s articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

## HTML Table Basics

# Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

# Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users: screen readers, used by blind people, interpret the tags that exist in an HTML page and read out the contents to the user. Because tables are not the right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screen readers’ output will be confusing to their users.

# List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

# Table Header: <th> special cells that go at the start of a row or column and define the type of data that row or column contains (as an example, see the “Person” and “Age” cells in the first example shown in this article).
# Table Rows: <tr> To stop a row from growing and start placing subsequent cells on a second row, we need to use the <tr> element (‘tr’ stands for ‘table row’).
# Table Data: <td> The smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created by a <td> element>

## Introducing Constructors 

# What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

# Using object literals is fine when you only need to create one object, but if you have to create more than one, as in the previous section, they’re seriously inadequate. We have to write out the same code for every object we create, and if we want to change some properties of the object - like adding a height property - then we have to remember to update every object.

# How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

# It's not exactly useful when writing out the code by hand, but it's vital for when we start using constructors to create multiply objects from a single object.

# Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

# At one of my previous jobs I had this old man teach me how to operate a forklift. He showed me first, then he had me do the same for every one he did. I inheritance
