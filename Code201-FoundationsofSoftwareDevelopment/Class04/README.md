## To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

# A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element

## The href attribute contains what information?

# The href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

## What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

# It's easy to throw links up on your page. That's not enough. We need to make our links accessible to all readers, regardless of their current context and which tools they prefer.

## What is meant by “normal flow”?

#  Normal flow is designed to make a readable document.

## What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

# A block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and the element grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. 

## ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

# Static positioning is the default that every element gets. It just means "put the element into its normal position in the document flow — nothing special to see here."

## Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

# An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. 

## What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

# One key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. 

## Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

# This form of creating a function is also known as function declaration. It is always hoisted, so you can call function above function definition and it will work fine.

## What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

# A parameter is a variable that is declared in the function definition, and it represents a value that the function expects to receive when it is called. 

# An argument is the actual value that is passed into a function when it is called. It is the value that is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function definition.

## Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

# Social skills are essential in the workplace because they enable individuals to communicate effectively and build positive relationships with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders. Good social skills involve active listening, clear communication, empathy, and respect for others. These skills help to establish trust, foster teamwork, and create a positive work environment. Employees with strong social skills are better equipped to collaborate effectively, resolve conflicts, and negotiate with others, which can lead to increased productivity, better decision-making, and higher job satisfaction. 

# Engaged collaboration in the workplace refers to a high level of active participation and cooperation between team members towards achieving common goals. Engaged collaboration can have several benefits for both individuals and organizations. When team members work collaboratively, they are more likely to feel motivated and engaged with their work, leading to increased job satisfaction and productivity. Collaboration also encourages the sharing of ideas and perspectives, which can lead to innovative solutions and new ways of approaching problems.
