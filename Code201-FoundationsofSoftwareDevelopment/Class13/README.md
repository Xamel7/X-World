## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

# Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

# Storing information locally on a userâ€™s computer is a powerful strategy for a developer who is creating something for the Web.The main problem with HTTP as the main transport layer of the Web is that it is stateless. This means that when you use an application and then close it, its state will be reset the next time you open it. If you close an application on your desktop and re-open it, its most recent state is restored.

# What information should not be stored in local storage?

# Any type of personal info like passwords or personal information.

# Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

# Local storage are stored as objects and can be converted by using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods.
