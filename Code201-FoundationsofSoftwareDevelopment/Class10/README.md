## Debugging
# Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

# Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

# Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

# List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

# Most errors I ran into were just syntax errors and they were an easy fix with the developer tools. Either a misspell here or an incorrect input there.

# How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

# Not sure about influence but this is a very useful skill to have in my repertoire for the future of my career because it can help me find issues early on in my code.

# How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

# A debugger is a tool that helps you find and fix problems in your code. With a JavaScript debugger, you can step through your code line by line, examine variables and their values, and test different parts of your code to see how they're working.

# Define what a breakpoint is.

# A breakpoint is like a pause button on a movie. It examines your program and investigates it for errors and issues of any kind.It allows you to sweep and stop for need be problems.

# What is the call stack?

# The call stack is a data structure used by computer programs to keep track of the sequence of function calls made during the execution of a program. When a function is called, its parameters and local variables are stored on the stack, along with the memory address of the next instruction to be executed after the function call. This memory address is called the return address. The call stack is important because it allows the program to keep track of where it is in the execution of a complex sequence of function calls, but if the call stack becomes too deep, the program may run out of memory and crash.
