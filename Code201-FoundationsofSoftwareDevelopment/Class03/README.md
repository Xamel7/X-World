## When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

# The <ul> element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle, or a square.

## How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

# The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

## When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

# The <ol> and <ul> elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the <ol> element, the order is meaningful. To determine which one to use, try changing the order of the list items; if the meaning is changed, the <ol> element should be used, otherwise you can use <ul>.

## Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

# An integer to start counting from for the list items. Always an Arabic numeral (1, 2, 3, etc.), even when the numbering type is letters or Roman numerals. For example, to start numbering elements from the letter "d" or the Roman numeral "iv," use start="4".

## Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

# Margin-The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. Setting a negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other things on the page. Whether you are using the standard or alternative box model, the margin is always added after the size of the visible box has been calculated.

# Padding- The padding sits between the border and the content area and is used to push the content away from the border. Unlike margins, you cannot have a negative padding. Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding.

## List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

# Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.

# Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

# Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

# Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.


## What data types can you store inside of an Array?

# We can store various data types — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. We can also mix data types in a single array — we do not have to limit ourselves to storing only numbers in one array, and in another only strings.

## Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

# Yes, because you can put multiple arrays inside an array.

## List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

Addition assignment-Adds the value to the right of the operand to a variable.
Subtraction assignment- subtracts the value of the right operand.
Multiplication assignment-multiplies a variable by the value of the operand.
Division assignment- divides a variable by the value of the right operand
Exponentiation assignment-raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.

## Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

The plus sign can mean different things depends on what you put on either side.
(a+c)turns into 10 + false which turns to 10 + 0 =10
Then it adds 10 + `dog` which = `10` + `dog`= `10dog`

## Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

If its cold outside; send a message to the user warning them it may be cold.

## Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

If I want something done multiple times or something done until a condition is met.
