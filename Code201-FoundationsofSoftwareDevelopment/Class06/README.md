## How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

# An object  is like a bucket that has multiply objects stored within it.

## What are some advantages to creating object literals?

# It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database.

## How do objects differ from arrays?

# Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.

## Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

# Dot notation is generally preferred over bracket notation because it is more succinct and easier to read.For example, if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.

## Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

# It refers to the dog,and a few characteristic it has such as the name, age, and color.An it's also calling the functions that were declared above.It's an advantage because it calls multiply objects in a function.

## What is the DOM?

# The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

## Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

# The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.The DOM is not part of the JavaScript language, but is instead a Web API used to build websites.The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language, making the structural representation of the document available from a single, consistent API.
